# Pencil

Pencil is my art-drawing app project. It's really more or less an attempt to familiarize myself
with the various functions of a painting app. 
I don't expect it to be incredible. 
I just want it to be functional, clean in design, and a good lesson or ten in app dev.

I've had decent luck rendering the app's basic tools visually: color-variable, size-variable brushes and erasers. 
But much of the functionality of these tools is still missing. 
ex., I still need to get the slider bar to show the RGB separated tones, as well as setting up the sliders to respond to a "mouseclick",
"while" inside specific parameters.
I also still need to get the slider to respond to a local mousePress function,
and to build up the result color in the fore-background hue boxes.
Note: the eraser can be a straight result of the background hue, 
but I'd like to write additional functionality into the pencil: opacity. 

I've started a spin-off which I'm using to clear up the code for the RGB sliders. 
At present, I'm focusing attention on the correspondence of the brush to Red tones 
The size function of the pencil slider might be a good secondary consideration.
(though perhaps a different spin-off is called for; we can fix it for the meantime). 

Anyhow, it's coming along slowly. If you have suggestions, feel free to share! :)
